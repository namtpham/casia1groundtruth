# Groundtruth of spliced images in dataset CASIA 1.0

* CASIA 2.0 groundtruth dataset is avaiable at: https://github.com/namtpham/casia2groundtruth

* Please notice that the authors made mistakes in naming the files. 
If you already downloaded the dataset, I recommend you to rename the tampered images using the commands in the excel file. 
Otherwise, you can use the modified version of dataset. 

* Since the owners' server is no longer avaiable, I upload the dataset to my drive, including original dataset and the modified version (renaming dozens of images in tampering folder). Please visit one of the following links to download (~91 MB): 

* Google Drive: https://bit.ly/37TuHRx
* One Drive: https://bit.ly/3nXyYJw

Due to the lack of manual file, I write up here the naming convention:

## Authentic images: 800 images (8 categories, 100 images in each category).

Au_ani_0001.jpg

Au: Authentic

ani: animal category

Other categories: arc (architecture), art, cha (characters), nat (nature), pla (plants), sec, txt (texture)

## Tampering images

a. Spliced image

        Sp_D_CND_A_pla0005_pla0023_0281.jpg
* Sp: Splicing
* D: Different (means the tampered region was copied from the different image)
* Next 4 letters stand for the techniques they used to create the images. Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly.
* pla0005: the source image
* pla0023: the target image
* 0281: tampered image ID

b. Copy-move images

        Sp_S_CND_A_pla0016_pla0016_0196.jpg
* Sp: Tampering
* S: Same (means the tampered region was copied from the same image)
* And the rest is similar to case a.
